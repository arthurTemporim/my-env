### bashrc
  I founded here
  
  `http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-general-1/ultimate-prompt-and-bashrc-file-4175518169/`
  
  a link to a fully complete bashrc file, to apply, just need to use this command:
  
  `/bin/rm -f ~/.bashrc* && cd ~ && wget http://mindnugget.com/bashrc/.bashrc && wget http://mindnugget.com/bashrc/.bashrc_help`
  
  and i made some changes after that.
  
### vimrc
