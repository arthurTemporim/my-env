### bashrc
  I found [here](http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-general-1/ultimate-prompt-and-bashrc-file-4175518169/) a link to fully complete bashrc file, to apply it you need to use this command:
  
```sh
/bin/rm -f ~/.bashrc* && cd ~ && wget http://mindnugget.com/bashrc/.bashrc && wget http://mindnugget.com/bashrc/.bashrc_help
```
  
### vimrc
  In [lappis vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) repository contains a very nice vimrc, mainly i use it.
